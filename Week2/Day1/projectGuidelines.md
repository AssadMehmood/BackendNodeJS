# Project using Node.js, Express Framework &amp; MongoDB
## Requirements and Guidelines  #

### Introduction

The time is here to kickoff project, taking everything we have learned into Server side of the web application. Set up the back end (Server side). The time frame will be exactly 3 days. Let's see what we can do!

This project will showcase the Node.js using Express and MongoDB which has been learned in this course. 

### High Level Goals
The goal of this project is to practice individually on creating a dynamic API for our web applications using what you have learned in this course.

## Project Requirements

The following minimum requirement should be  met in the project:

* Your time should be focused on creating something you are passionate about. Something that might help you or others.
* You should implement DRY principles for the rest of your life :smile:
* As a user you have to be able to navigate some information and display it.
* Plan ahead of coding by having some wireframing.
* Prepare slides for the project presentation.
* There needs to be a plan before hand that needs to be aproved by your instructor.
* You have to use Node.JS, Express, Mongoose and any other releated npm packages.
* CRUD operations from the MongoDB are mandatory.
* Create the Github repository for your project, and push the code frequently to the repository, **at least twice** every day.
* Project should also have a readme file describing the project
* Get the repos documented to your instructors to see before you start coding.
* Project must be ready before the deadline.
  
  

## Project Ideas
The project ideas will be given to you and are added as well. The implementation of the idea should meet the minimum project requirements.
- The idea should be big enough to work on it for the project duration, and still have extra features to work on in the future.
- Don't be afraid to have creative thoughts and features that you may add them in the projects. if you are not sure how it could be implemented we will help you out.
- Get your project approved by the instructor.

## Project Stretch Goals
- Login & Register functionality.
- Server side of the application should also have proper structure. 
- Make sure to write clean code with good style (use Prettier).
- The code should comply with coding standards, i.e. variables should have proper names, code should be readable etc.


## Bonus
- Will be added, so keep refreshing the page!
